      <h2>How to Join</h2>
      <p>Interested in joining our CS2 team? We hold regular tryouts throughout the semester in the CSU esports tryout discord server, click here to join! We're always looking for new players,
        as we could always use more additions to our main roster as players graduate or decide to leave. If our main roster is full, we could also always use substitute players! If there is enough interest,
        we may be able to start a B team that will also compete in tournaments.

        When trying out, if we have enough players we will run a custom 5v5 match with current players, the coach, and the players trying out. If not, we will play on Faceit to gauge your skill and see what kind of player you are.
        After the tryout period, the current players and coach will discuss among themselves to see whether or not you would be a good fit on the team. Even if you don't make it onto the main team, you can always play as a sub, or if there is enough people, play on the second team.

        If you make it onto the team, you will have to sign the IMLeagues form found in the main CSU esports server that you will be invited to upon being accepted into the team. We are all looking forward to seeing the new talent, so please do not hesitate to sign up for tryouts or directly message the CS2 coordinator!
