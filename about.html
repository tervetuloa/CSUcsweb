      <h2>About CSU Counter-Strike 2</h2>
      <p>
        We are affiliated with the CSU esports club, and are a competitive team formed by students at Colorado State University that play Counter-Strike 2. Our goal is to create a fun environment for us to represent our school and compete in the game we like to play.</p>
      <p>We participate in collegiate leagues, scrims, and tournaments throughout the academic semester. The main leagues we play in are NACE (North American Collegiate Esports) and any open Faceit tournaments that we are able to join. If we have enough interest, we may also start competing in ESEA open or collegiate.
        We also participate in at least one LAN event per semester, with it usually being border wars against Wyoming, but there are occasionally events in Denver and also events within the club, such as game swap. Outside of the game, we as a team tend to bond and hang out and go to restaurants and group activities together, so it is also a great chance to socialize with people who play the same game as you! If any of this interests you, go to the "how to join" section to get information on trying out for the team!
